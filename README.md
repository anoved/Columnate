## Acknowledgements

Columnate uses [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability). Columnate is a simplified rewrite of my earlier effort [McReadability](https://github.com/anoved/mcreadability), which was based on a now-obselete predecessor of Mozilla Readability. Bookmarklet creation is modelled after [Bookmarkletify](https://martijnbrekelmans.com/bookmarkletify/) by Martijn Brekelmans.
